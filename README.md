# Relationship Between LinkNYC and NYC Demographic and Household Broadband Access
## Abstract:
Broadband access is not just a necessity, but also a human right recently recognized by the United Nations. While internet-based technologies are increasingly ingrained in the lives of city-dwellers, millions of people in major cities like New York lack access to high-speed internet. LinkNYC is an infrastructure project that replaced payphones and provides free  broadband-based Wi-Fi connection. This research seeks to start a discussion on the role this new technology carries in democratizing Internet access in New York and its place in day-to-day activities of the residents. We use bivariate analysis, clustering, and time-series methods to assess the relationships between LinkNYC, socio-economic factors, and 311 Service Requests. Additionally, we examine how has the public perception of the technology changed over the years by scraping and analyzing web articles mentioning LinkNYC. From our work, we conclude that LinkNYC has played an important role for the city community so far and that there is still room for improvement and further research.
